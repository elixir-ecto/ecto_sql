Ecto SQL
=========

[![Build Status](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/actions)

Ecto SQL ([documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql)) provides building blocks for writing SQL adapters for Ecto. It features:

  * The Ecto.Adapters.SQL module as an entry point for all SQL-based adapters
  * Default implementations for Postgres (Ecto.Adapters.Postgres), MySQL (Ecto.Adapters.MyXQL), and MSSQL (Ecto.Adapters.Tds)
  * A test sandbox (Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox) that concurrently runs database tests inside transactions
  * Support for database migrations via Mix tasks

To learn more about getting started, [see the Ecto repository](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto).

## Running tests

Clone the repo and fetch its dependencies:

    $ git clone https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql.git
    $ cd ecto_sql
    $ mix deps.get
    $ mix test.all

Note that `mix test.all` runs the tests in `test/` and the `integration_test`s for each adapter: `pg`, `myxql` and `tds`.

You can also use a local Ecto checkout if desired:

    $ ECTO_PATH=../ecto mix test.all

You can run tests against a specific Ecto adapter by using the `ECTO_ADAPTER` environment variable:

    $ ECTO_ADAPTER=pg mix test

MySQL and PostgreSQL can be installed directly on most systems. For MSSQL, you may need to run it as a Docker image:

    docker run -d -p 1433:1433 --name mssql -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=some!Password' mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
